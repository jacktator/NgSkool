# What went wrong / took too much time

I ran out of time on the front end, as the [BackEnd](https://github.com/jacktator/NgSkool_Lambda) took a lot longer then expected.

Other than that, not much

# Todos

Due to time constraint, many features are left as 'idea'.
A `todo` had been added to comments.

# What would I have done differently?

- I should have used MEAN **FullStack** boilerplate/starter-kit/scaffold.
- I'd customize bootstrap theme.sass
- I'd better modularize components on home page
- I'd write rest api service classes to be more robust
- I'd write e2e tests for components and services.
- Build Data Models, possibly build SDKs (/src/app/core/models/)
