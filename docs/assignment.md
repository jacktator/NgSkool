## Assignment

Create a project in which we can view schools, search/filter and add a new school.
For each school, at least the following attributes should be captured:

1. Name
1. Address (street, suburb, postcode and state)
1. Amount of students registered

The list-view should display all schools and allow for a search on name and address.
Also, it would be nice to be able to filter the list based on State.

Any school I add, should be stored in some sort of persistence. Having a couple of schools
preloaded would be great.

Finally, if you can make the app look nic and save yourself some time by using a UI Library,
please do.

## Technology

For frontend, Angular would be preferred, but you can choose something else. 
For backend you can choose whatever JS framework you are comfortable with.

## Assessment

We will be looking at your app composition, code reuse, library knowledge, performance, testing
and documentation.
You get bonus points if you have time to look at deployment or using containers.

## Q & A

In this assessment, if you want to validate any criteria, you are allowed/encouraged to ask
questions.

Good luck!
