# Overview.

While it's easy to complete to technical requirement for the project, I personally think it's a good case to showcase my understanding of a good architecture of Full Stack project, and demonstrate wide range of skill.

Therefore a time will be allocated in between hand in documenting and testing, and the other half in actual Full Stack Dev.

Let's dance.  

# Front End

On the Front End, I'm goin with Angular 7 + BootStrap 4. To save time, I am going to choose a boilerplate/scaffolding tool. TODO

As I am going to use AWS for the backend (explanation below), I am going to choose a bootstrap that's performant and front-end only.

A quick search leads to to [most-update to-date starter-ket](https://github.com/ngx-rocket/starter-kit). 

It fulfills the requirement of Angular + BootStrap. It also has a good structure setup for e2e testing and good docs. One thing it lacks is the CI config with Travis, but I can add that myself relatively easy.
